#Suggestify

This project is created with the purpose of giving the user accurate recommendations based on songs they input.

This project was created using Next.js, Spotify's API, MongoDB and Next Auth.

The project is available at https://suggestify-gilt.vercel.app/, but is still in development mode, which does not allow for public use, but a demo for the project can be accessed at https://youtu.be/XJgUiqF7fxE
